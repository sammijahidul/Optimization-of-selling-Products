# Association-Rule-Learning
Suppose a big store owner wants to optimize the sell of the products.
For this type of problems we can apply Association Rule Learning to know where to place the product perfectly in the store.
The main idea of this Association rule is " People who brought this also brought that ".
Here, we have a dataset that contains 7500 transaction of all the different customers that brought a basket of products in a whole week.

One of the most popular Association rule is Apriori algorithm. Applied apriori algorithm to this dataset and apriori model gave some relevant list of products as, “if customers buy this product then they are likely to buy the other set of products".
This is exactly how apriori algorithm and association rule works.
